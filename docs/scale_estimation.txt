Unique movies: 100k
    Movie poster average size: 500KB
        Image storage: 500KB x 100k = 50 GB
    Additional movie metadata: 1KB per movie (including indexing for search)
        Metadata storage: 100MB

Unique users: 1M total users, 100k DAU
User data: about 1KB per user
    User data storage: 1 GB for user data

User/movie data:
    1000 seen, 1000 unseen movies per user
    25 bytes per seen record (user ID, preferred movie ID)

    1000 seen movies = up to 1M preferences per user, about 10,000 for NlogN sort
    Estimate: 2,000 recorded preferences per user
    About 50 bytes per preference (user id, preferred movie ID), not-preferred movie ID)

    User/movie data storage:
        50 bytes preference * 2000 preferences per user * 1M total users 
        + 25 bytes * 2000 movies per user * 1M total users
        = 150GB preference data

        75% utilization = 200GB total data

Activity:
    1 new seen, 1 new unseen movie per day per DAU = + 50MB/day
    100 new preferences per DAU per day = +500 MB/day
        New storage needs = +550MB/day
        Incoming data bandwidth = 6.3 Kbps
    
    200 movie poster views per DAU per day = 10 TB/day
        = 116 Mbps outgoing

Caching:
    Top 20% of movie posters = 10 GB of cache
    Caching 1 DAU's preference data = 300KB/user 
        x100k DAU = 30GB of cache


Observations:
    Largest data capacity need = user preference data, but unlikely to ever require specialized tools
    Largest bandwidth usage = movie posters

    Most active users likely to use substantially higher bandwidth and storage than less active users
