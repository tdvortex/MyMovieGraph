Deployment infrastructure: Docker on Heroku
    Rationale:
        Consistency between dev and prod environments
        Some dependencies may not support Windows, or might just be easier as a container
        Initial deployment will be single-instance but Docker improves future scalability improvements
        Heroku supports Postgres out of the box and has good free tiers

Backend platform: Django
    Python has useful libraries for all necessary database types.
    The "batteries included" design of Django will be more useful than Flask in handling interconnectedness.

Authentication: Djoser with JWTs
    Reduces load on SQL database

Testing platform: pytest
    Reliable, high-quality testing platform.
